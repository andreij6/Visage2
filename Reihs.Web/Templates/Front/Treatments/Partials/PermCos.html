<p>Nearly every woman reading this right now is either wearing make up – or will put some on in the very near future. Make up has come to be something that most women will not leave the house without having applied at least some mascara and lipstick – and today you will find very few women who don’t. Whether it be for the purpose of impressing that special fellow, a co-worker, or a boss – women wear make up day to day. Our aestheticians at Le Beau Visage understand the importance of skin care and your make up needs.</p>

<p>Make-up, however, can sometimes consume a lot of time in the hectic mornings – depending on how much one puts on – and it can be expensive. Le Beau Visage aestheticians are pleased to announce we now offer permanent cosmetics – also known as permanent pigment cosmetics. The main point of this “procedure” is to give you flawless makeup that you never have to take off or touch up!</p>

<p>The permanent makeup is generally applied to the eyebrows, eyelids, and lips – and we know that having these certain areas already made up could really help with any morning skin care scenario you may experience from day to day. Think about how long it takes you to put on everything in the morning, and deal with your kids, or spouse, or pets…(or all three) With m permanent cosmetics that 30-minute stand in front of the mirror can turn into 30 extra minutes to pick out what you’re going to wear or how you want your hair done!</p>
