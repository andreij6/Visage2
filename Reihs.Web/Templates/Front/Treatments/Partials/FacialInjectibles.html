<h1>Facial Injectibles</h1>
<p class="dropcap lead">Facial fillers are products such as collagen, hyaluronic acid and calcium hydroxyl apatite that rejuvenate facial skin by reducing or eliminating wrinkles, raising scar depressions, enhancing lips and replacing soft-tissue volume loss through facial injections. With age, our skin becomes more susceptible to wrinkles and sagging. Exposure to sun and years of muscle movement (squinting, chewing, smiling) contribute to tissue breakdown of the skin.</p>
<p>Facial fillers are temporary to long-lasting solutions administered through a few tiny facial injections on specific areas of the face. Various types of facial fillers are available; each is designed with one or several purposes, such as wrinkle reduction and lip augmentation. A qualified medical professional can help you determine which facial injections and what injectable fillers treatments are right for you. Facial fillers will volumize creases and folds in the face in areas that have lost fat and collagen as we age. Hyaluronic acid is the natural filler substance in your body. The face starts to lack volume and appears aged with deeper nasolabial folds, unaesthetic marionette lines, a deeper mentalis fold, the lips start to thin, and turning down the corners of the lips. Hyaluronic acid fillers such as Restylane and Juvederm are then injected extraorally right underneath these folds to replace the volume lost which creates a younger look in the face. Dermal fillers can be used for high lip line cases, asymmetrical lips around the mouth, lip augmentation, and completingcosmetic dentistry cases by creating a beautiful, young-looking frame around the teeth </p>

<h3>Botox&reg;</h3>
<p>Wrinkles result from a combination of many factors. It's not just about cellular changes, collagen depletion, or damage caused by free radicals. When you frown or concentrate, the muscles between your brows contract, causing your skin to furrow and fold. And when you squint, the muscles around your eyes contract and cause crow's feet. BOTOX&reg; Cosmetic works beneath the skin's surface and targets the underlying muscle activity that causes frown lines and crow's feet to form over time.</p>

<h3>Dysport&reg;</h3>
